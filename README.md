# Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋

**Competitive Programmer | Java Backend Engineer | Problem Solver**

I build scalable backend systems and solve algorithmic challenges daily. Fueled by Codeforces contests and clean code.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science graduate passionate about **competitive programming** and **backend engineering**. My primary love is **Codeforces**, where I regularly participate in contests and sharpen my problem-solving skills. I believe in consistent practice, logical thinking, and writing optimized solutions. Beyond algorithms, I design and build backend systems using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, focusing on scalability, clean architecture, and efficient data handling.

## 🏆 Competitive Programming

I'm deeply involved in the competitive programming community, solving problems across multiple platforms:

- **Codeforces** ⭐ — My primary platform. Regular contest participation and focused rating improvement.
- **LeetCode** — Daily problem-solving for DSA mastery.
- **CodeChef** — Long and short contests.
- **StatCoder** — Exploring diverse problem sets.

I work across the full spectrum of DSA: arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, segment trees, and beyond. My goal is to write clean, optimized solutions that scale with complexity.
